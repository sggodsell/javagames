I will be creating and depositing a number of Java games with source code.
The Source code is inside the .jar files, which people can use unzip to look
at all of the source code and resources (images, sounds, README.txt)

To execute this jar, type in the following:
   java -jar Invaders.jar
   
To change the game setting click on the settings cog wheel up at the top, right.
Users can change the alien number of rows, and columns, as well as the maximum
number of shots aliens can fire at one time.  The barriers can also be removed,
and more.
